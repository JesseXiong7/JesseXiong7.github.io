# Block 1 – Foundations of IT-Data Analytics
### First Semester

Block 1 represents the start of my journey in the **IT–Data Analytics** program at CVTC.  
During my first semester, I completed **Intro to Computers & Programming (10-152-118)** and **Database 1 (10-152-132)**.  
These two courses gave me a strong technical foundation in computer logic, programming basics, and relational database design. The skills I learned continue to guide every analytics project I build and helped me understand how data and technology work together to solve real problems.

## 10-152-118 Intro to Computers & Programming  

### Overview  
This course introduced me to the main areas of information technology and programming. I learned how computers work from both a hardware and software perspective, how operating systems manage data, and how programming languages are used to create solutions. I practiced using the Command Prompt to navigate and organize files, wrote my first JavaScript programs, and explored how problem solving, logic, and data connect in the IT field. The course also covered cybersecurity awareness and introduced me to GitHub for storing and sharing projects.    

### What I Learned  
- Identified physical components of a computer and learned how hardware communicates with software  
- Applied problem-solving models and practiced breaking challenges into step-by-step logic  
- Navigated file systems using the Command Prompt (CLI) to create, manage, and organize folders  
- Built a **Command Prompt Tree Diagram** to visualize directory structures  
- Wrote small JavaScript programs to manipulate graphics and text in a browser  
- Created projects such as **jsActivity.html** (smiley face) and **jxiong34_turtle.html** (animated rainbow)  
- Learned foundational cybersecurity concepts including passwords, phishing, and account protection  
- Used GitHub for source control and learned the basics of storing, tracking, and managing code

### Reflection  
This course gave me a solid understanding of how computers and software work together. I learned how to use both the Command Prompt and programming tools to organize data and create simple programs. It helped me build problem-solving skills and confidence in writing code. I also learned the importance of cybersecurity and version control in IT. Overall, this course gave me the foundation I needed to move forward in programming, databases, and data analytics.

## 🗄️ 10-152-132 Database 1  

### Overview  
Database 1 introduced me to relational databases and SQL. I learned how to design tables, define relationships, and use SQL queries to retrieve and analyze data. This course showed me how organized data drives business decisions and analytics.  

### What I Learned  
- Studied how database systems store and manage organizational data  
- Learned key terms: tables, fields, records, primary keys, foreign keys  
- Designed Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERDs) to map data relationships  
- Applied normalization rules (1NF–3NF) to improve data structure  
- Built ERDs for **Drone Module 2** and **Rewards Module 2**  
- Restored databases and created tables in SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)  
- Wrote SQL queries including `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`, and aggregate functions  
- Used JOINs, subqueries, and UNION to combine and analyze data  
- Debugged SQL errors and validated relationships for accuracy and performance  
- Cleaned, organized, and analyzed datasets for use in reporting and visualization

- [Jxiong34_m7.3.sql](block1_artifacts/database1/Jxiong34_m7.3.sql)  
- [Jxiong34_m8.sql](block1_artifacts/database1/Jxiong34_m8.sql)

### Reflection  
This course taught me how to design efficient databases and write queries that turn raw data into useful insights. I learned how important clean data and good design are for accuracy. Database 1 helped me build the foundation for advanced courses in ETL, Power BI, and data visualization.

## Block 1 Summary  
Through **Intro to Computers & Programming** and **Database 1**, I built the core skills that define my path as a data analyst. I learned how systems store, process, and organize data and how programming logic connects to analytics. These courses taught me to think critically, structure my work clearly, and see how data flows from code to insight.
