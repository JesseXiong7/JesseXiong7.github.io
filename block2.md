# Block 2 – Building Technical Skills in Programming, Databases & Business Analytics  
### Second Semester

Block 2 marks a shift from foundational learning to hands-on technical application in the IT–Data Analytics program at CVTC.  
During this semester, I completed **Programming Fundamentals (10-152-101)**, **Database 2 (10-152-136)**, **Business Analytics (10-102-109)**, **Systems Analysis & Design (10-156-101)**, and **BI Data 1 – Paginated Reports (10-156-103)**.

This semester focused on building practical skills: writing structured programs, creating multi-table databases, analyzing data with spreadsheets, modeling information systems, and producing professional paginated reports. Each course pushed me into deeper technical work and expanded my ability to apply tools in real business scenarios.

## 🧠 10-152-101 Programming Fundamentals  

### Overview  
This course taught me the foundations of software development and helped me understand how programs are planned, written, tested, and debugged. I learned the difference between logic and syntax, how data flows through a program using input and output, and how various programming structures control application behavior. I practiced designing algorithms using pseudocode and flowcharts and built working JavaScript programs that reinforced problem-solving and code structure.

### What I Learned  
- Explored stages of software development and differences between compilers and interpreters  
- Understood why testing is required in every stage of development  
- Learned to identify and resolve logic vs. syntax errors  
- Created pseudocode and flowcharts to outline program logic  
- Used arithmetic, relational, and logical operators to guide program decisions  
- Wrote decision structures using IF, ELSE IF, nested statements, and switch cases  
- Practiced FOR and WHILE loops for repetition, including counters and accumulators  
- Applied test plans to validate loop behavior  
- Built structured programs using functions  
- Worked with arrays and dictionaries to store multiple values  
- Used return statements to send information back to the main program
