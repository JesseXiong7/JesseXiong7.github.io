**Logic and Problem Solving**  
I practiced writing pseudocode to outline program solutions and created flowcharts to visualize step-by-step logic. I worked with arithmetic, relational, and logical operators to perform calculations and guide program decisions. I learned how input, output, and assignment operations transmit and store information inside a program.

**Decision Structures**  
I wrote decision-based programs using IF and IF/Else statements. I created nested decision structures to handle more complex conditions and used switch statements to simplify multiple-case decisions.

**Loops and Repetition**  
I gained experience writing counted loops using FOR and uncounted loops using WHILE. I applied counters and accumulators to track totals during repetition and used test plans to ensure each loop worked correctly.

**Functions and Data Structures**  
I learned how to build cleaner programs by breaking logic into functions. I worked with arrays and dictionaries to store multiple values and used return statements to pass information back to the main program. These skills helped me write more structured and organized code.
