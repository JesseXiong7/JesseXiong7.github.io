# 💻 Block 3 – Building Data Skills in BI, Python & ETL  
### Third Semester

Block 3 expanded my technical abilities in business intelligence, Python programming, and data integration. This semester I completed **BI Data 2 – Interactive (10-156-106)**, **Python Data Programming (10-156-102)**, and **Introductory ETL (10-156-109)**.

These courses helped me deepen my Power BI skills, write full Python programs, build data pipelines, clean multi-source datasets, and better understand automation, data flow, and analytics workflows.

## 📊 10-156-106 BI Data 2 – Interactive  

### Overview  
In this course, I learned how to use Power BI Desktop, Power BI Service, and Power BI Q&A. I practiced connecting to data sources such as SQL Server, Excel, and web data, cleaning data through Power Query, modeling relationships, creating KPIs, and building interactive dashboards.

### What I Learned
- Built interactive dashboards using slicers, drill-throughs, bookmarks, and custom visuals  
- Connected Power BI to SQL Server and imported tables for reporting  
- Used Power Query to clean, transform, and reshape raw datasets  
- Created DAX measures and KPIs to support business decision-making  
- Published reports to Power BI Service and explored collaboration features  
- Practiced Row-Level Security (RLS) and data governance concepts  
- Used Power BI Q&A for natural-language data exploration  
- Learned how enterprise business users interact with dashboards  
- Explored BI tools like Tableau, Looker, Sisense, Oracle, Snowflake & Databricks  
- Applied Agile concepts to improve collaboration and iterative development

### Reflection  
BI Data 2 strengthened my ability to take raw data and turn it into interactive insights. This class helped me feel more confident working with real datasets, building polished dashboards, and applying data modeling techniques. I gained a better understanding of how BI tools support business decisions and how analysts communicate results through visuals. The hands-on labs gave me experience that I can apply directly in real-world reporting and dashboard development.

## 🐍 10-156-102 Python Data Programming  

### Overview  
This course taught me Python fundamentals, allowing me to write programs, analyze datasets, automate processes, and work with databases. I practiced using IDLE, JupyterLab, and libraries such as Pandas.

### What I Learned  
- Installed Python, set up IDLE/JupyterLab, and wrote my first program  
- Understood Python syntax, variables, data types, operators, and expressions  
- Wrote programs using loops (for/while) and conditional logic  
- Created functions and worked with arguments and return values  
- Built programs using lists and list operations  
- Practiced Object-Oriented Programming with classes and objects  
- Used file I/O to read/write CSV and text files  
- Connected Python to SQLite to insert, update, and query data  
- Used Pandas for cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing data  
- Used Git/GitHub for version control and project publishing

### Reflection  
Python Data Programming helped me understand how coding works behind the scenes and showed me how powerful automation can be in data analytics. I became much more comfortable writing my own scripts, using libraries like Pandas, and building programs from scratch. This course also introduced me to database integration and file handling, which will be essential for building future analytics pipelines and machine learning projects.

## 🔄 10-156-109 Introductory ETL  

### Overview  
This course introduced the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process and its importance in data integration. I worked with Power Query and Alteryx to clean, normalize, and prepare data for analysis.

### What I Learned  
- Understood ETL concepts and why data integration matters  
- Extracted data from structured and unstructured sources  
- Cleaned & transformed datasets using Power Query  
- Combined multiple data sources into a single target  
- Applied data quality checks and validation techniques  
- Normalized data to reduce redundancy and fix inconsistencies  
- Built ETL workflows using Alteryx Designer  
- Used functions to shape, filter, merge, and process datasets  
- Loaded cleaned datasets into analytical tools  
- Explored data warehousing and cloud storage concepts  

### Artifacts & Projects  
*(Artifacts will be added later.)*

### Reflection  
Introductory ETL showed me how essential clean and organized data is to every analytics process. I learned how to fix inconsistent datasets, improve data quality, and build structured workflows using Power Query and Alteryx. This course helped me understand how data flows from raw sources into reports and dashboards. It also improved my ability to troubleshoot messy data and prepare it effectively for analysis, which is one of the most important skills for any data analyst.
